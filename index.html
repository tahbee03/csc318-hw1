        <h1>Why I Love Music</h1>
        <p>
            Music is a ubiquitous element and it influences each
            and every one of us in different ways. It is an
            important part of <i>my</i> life because the messages 
            behind each song I listen to are very sentimental and 
            sometimes even relate to what I go through in my own
            life. It's also important because different types 
            of music take me through different types of
            experiences simply because of how they sound -- 
            whether there are lyrics involved or not.
